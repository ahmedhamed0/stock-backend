Build the Application: Run the following command in your project root directory:

./mvnw clean package


This command will generate a JAR file in the target directory (e.g., *-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar).

Store sensitive or environment-specific configurations in application.properties or application.yml files, or pass them as command-line arguments or environment variables:

Use a file like application-prod.properties for production-specific settings.
Activate the production profile when running:

	spring.profiles.active=prod
	
Run the Application

Run the JAR file generated during the build process:

	java -jar target/my-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

To set the spring.profiles.active property directly, use:

	java -jar target/my-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
	
Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Data :
 
Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., database credentials) are passed using environment variables or a secure configuration service.

Run the Application as a Background Service:

Using nohup:
	nohup java -jar target/my-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod &
	
Using systemd: Create a service file at /etc/systemd/system/my-app.service:

[Unit]
Description=My Spring Boot Application
After=syslog.target

[Service]
User=your-username
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /path/to/your-app.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
SuccessExitStatus=143
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Enable and start the service:

	sudo systemctl enable my-app
	sudo systemctl start my-app
	
Secure the Application

Enable HTTPS: Configure SSL/TLS by adding server.ssl properties in application.properties or use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to handle SSL.
Ensure CORS policies are configured properly to handle requests from different origins.
Set security headers and consider additional security libraries like spring-security.

Monitor and Log the Application

Centralize logs: Use tools like Logback with an external log management system (e.g., ELK stack).
Monitor: Use monitoring tools like Spring Boot Actuator, Prometheus, or integrate with APM tools such as New Relic or Datadog.


Reverse Proxy :

If running behind Nginx or Apache, configure them to proxy traffic to your Spring Boot app:

server {
    listen 8081;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8081;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}


Restart Nginx:
	sudo systemctl restart nginx
	
	
Additional Production Tips
Set JVM options for memory optimization, e.g., -Xmx512m -Xms256m.
Implement load balancing with a reverse proxy or use tools like Kubernetes for container orchestration.
Regularly update your dependencies and the JDK for security patches.
By following these steps, you can build and run a Spring Boot application in a production environment efficiently.
